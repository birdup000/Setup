This is more of a todo but I gotta add the Gnome Tweak Configurations and extensions I use to the script like Desktop Icons NG (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2087/desktop-icons-ng-ding/) and Dash to Dock  (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/)

use example ‚ùØ (gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock click-action 'minimize-or-previews') to set settings within the extension


Also use Extension manager for now (yay -S extension-manager) to install stuff or the Gnome Extension or Addon on Firefox or Chromium browser
